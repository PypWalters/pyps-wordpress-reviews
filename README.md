# Pyp's WordPress Reviews

This is a light-weight WordPress plugin that extends native WordPress comments to add a 5-star review field based on post type.

## Use-case

Lets say you have a post type for recipes on your WordPress site, as well as a blog about personal experiences in your life. You may want visitors to give a rating to your recipes, but not your personal blog stories.
